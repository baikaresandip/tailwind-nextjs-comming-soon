This is a simple coming soon template built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is a lightweight and responsive template that can be used for various projects that require a "coming soon" page.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/baikaresandip/tailwind-nextjs-comming-soon.git`

Install dependencies: `npm install`

Start the development server: `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Running with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t nextjs-tailwind-comingsoon .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-tailwind-comingsoon
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
